## Project Implementation

The web page has been developed to be an exact replica of the design provided in the Figma link using NextJS and Bootstrap.

The following technologies and best practices have been employed:

- **Javascript, HTML, CSS, NextJS and Bootstrap:** The project utilizes a combination of these technologies to create a responsive and visually appealing web page.

- **Responsive Design:** The webpage is designed to be fully responsive and should adapt seamlessly to various device widths without any breakage.

- **Components and Containers:** Proper use of components and containers has been maintained to ensure code modularity, scalability and reusability.

- **Login & Signup Modals:** The login and signup modals are implemented to appear on click, similar to any other modals (non functional).
